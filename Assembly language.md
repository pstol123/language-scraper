- Opis: In computer programming,  assembly language (alternatively assembler language[1] or symbolic machine code),[2][3][4] often referred to simply as assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.[5] Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but  constants, comments, assembler directives,[6] symbolic labels of, e.g., memory locations, registers, and macros[7][1] are generally also supported.
- Paradygmat: Imperative, unstructured, often metaprogramming (through macros), certain assemblers are structured or object-oriented
